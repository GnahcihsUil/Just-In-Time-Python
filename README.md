## JIT in Python

PyPy or Numba

This project aims at investigating and extending the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler PyPy of Python / Numba of Numpy. The JIT compiler helps accelerate the compilation and execution of Python / Numpy, by translating the bottleneck Python code directly into machine code (instead of byte code). We plan to study how to use JIT, why JIT makes Python faster, and the implementation of JIT. And if time permits, we will possibly compare JIT in PyPy and Numba, and extend one or two new features into Pypy.
